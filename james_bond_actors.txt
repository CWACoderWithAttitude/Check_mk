Unofficial Works

    Barry Nelson. Appeared in an episode of Climax! titled Casino Royale and based on the James Bond novels. This television episode first aired in 1954, making Nelson the first actor to appear as James Bond.
    David Niven. He appeared in the film Casino Royale released in 1967. This is not considered ‘official’ as it was not produced by EON Productions (who has produced all the official films) and was made to be a parody of spy films rather than a Bond film.
    Sean Connery. After his last appearance in the ‘official’ James Bond movies, Connery was told that he would never play Bond again. His reply was ‘Never Say Never Again’. That became the title of an unofficial James Bond film (not produced by EON) released in 1983 by Warner Brothers.
